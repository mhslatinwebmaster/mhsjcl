                    <p>Certamen means a struggle or competition. Academic tests are great but quite passive. Imagine a room with three teams, that is, twelve players, each individual armed with a single button, less than a centimeter of finger motion from answering a single question which, should he or she be correct, awards that team with exclusive points to the question. In short, a question is read, and if at any time a player is confident in an answer, even before the reader is finished, they may buzz in and respond. It's a race. It's stressful, it's intense, it's fun.</p>
